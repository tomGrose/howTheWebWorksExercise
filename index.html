            <br>
            7. An HTTP response is what the server sends back to the client after the client sent a request. It will provide the requested material, if it wasn't able to give back anything the matched the request it will reespond with an error code.
            <br>
            <br>

            9.  1. The browser finds the ip address for the dfomain using DNS 2. The browser sends a request to the ip address including any headers 3. The server will send a response back 4. if the response was succesful it will give a status code of 200, if not it will give a different status code for why it was unsuccesful. 5. The browser then builds out the DOM using the html 6. It will then look up the other resources it needs to build that page with other requests, looking for CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
